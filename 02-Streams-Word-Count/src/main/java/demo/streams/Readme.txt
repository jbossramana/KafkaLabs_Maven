KTable<String, Long> joinedCounts = counts1.join(counts2, (count1, count2) -> count1 + count2);
This line of code joins two KTable instances counts1 and counts2 together. Both KTable instances represent word counts, where the key is the word and the value is the count.

The join() method takes two arguments:

counts2: The KTable instance that we want to join with counts1.
(count1, count2) -> count1 + count2: The join function that specifies how to combine the values for the same key in both KTable instances.
The join function is defined as a lambda expression that takes two Long values (count1 and count2) as input and returns their sum (count1 + count2). This means that for each key that exists in both counts1 and counts2, the corresponding values are added together.

The result of the join operation is a new KTable instance joinedCounts, where each key-value pair represents the combined word count for that word across both input streams.

Note that the join operation is an inner join, which means that only keys that exist in both counts1 and counts2 will be included in the output. If you want to include keys that exist only in one of the input streams, you can use a left join or a right join instead.
